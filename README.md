We all know how difficult it is to create a list of our friends on Twitter and how hard is someone to follow us.

With this module you can display your friends or those who follow you on twitter. Also you can convince your website visitors to follow you, as well to display recent tweets of your friends.

The settings of the module is extremely easy and does not require from you any technical expertise. Among the options you can do, is to show your friends or show the users following you, to choose the color for the module, to decide the amount of users to display, and more.

The user interface for the administration panel of Joomla is already translated into seven languages. The available languages are:

English
Greek
Bulgarian
Czech
Danish
French
Italian

It should be noted that for most of the available translation languages other than Greek and English, has used the service Google Translate. For this reason, some of the languages may be needed corrections.

Note : The unit has a very distinctive link to our website at the bottom.
